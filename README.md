# NAIVE BAYES

Naïve Bayes algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm, which is based on Bayes theorem and used for solving classification problems.

It is mainly used in text classification that includes a high-dimensional training dataset.

Naïve Bayes Classifier is one of the simple and most effective Classification algorithms which helps in building the fast machine learning models that can make quick predictions.

## Bayes' Theorem:

Bayes' theorem is also known as Bayes' Rule or Bayes' law, which is used to determine the probability of a hypothesis with prior knowledge. It depends on the conditional probability.
The formula for Bayes' theorem is given as:

                         P(A/B)=(P(B/A) P(A))/P(B)
       
                Where,
                      P(A|B) is Posterior probability: Probability of hypothesis A on the observed event B.
                      P(B|A) is Likelihood probability: Probability of the evidence given that the probability of a hypothesis is true.
                      P(A) is Prior Probability: Probability of hypothesis before observing the evidence.
                      P(B) is Marginal Probability: Probability of Evidence.
